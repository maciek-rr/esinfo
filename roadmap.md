### Cluster Health
This section should provide a general overview of the cluster's health. This might include the status (green, yellow, or red), number of nodes, number of data nodes, active primary shards, active shards, relocating shards, initializing shards, and unassigned shards.

### Index Status
This section should display information about individual indices. Useful metrics might include index health status, number of documents, deleted documents, primary shard count, replica shard count, index size, and more.

### Node Statistics
Node-related information like node ID, name, role, IP address, CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, JVM heap usage, GC counts, GC time, and uptime.

### Search Performance
This section should report on search-related statistics, including query rate, query latency, fetch rate, fetch latency, and more.

### Indexing Performance
Similar to search performance, this section should include indexing statistics such as indexing rate, indexing latency, refresh rate, refresh latency, and more.

### Network and Disk I/O
Information regarding data input/output can be useful in identifying bottlenecks or potential points of failure. This might include network send/receive rates, disk read/write rates, and disk queue length.

### Task Management
A section dedicated to ongoing tasks in the cluster, like shard relocations, reindexing, or snapshot operations. This would display information such as task type, start time, running time, and more.

### Logs
A section to display warning and error logs. This can be useful for diagnosing issues with the cluster.

### Pending Tasks
It might also be useful to display information about tasks that are queued but not yet running. This could include information like task priority and how long the task has been waiting.

### Cache Statistics
This can display information about the various caches Elasticsearch uses (like the field data cache, query cache, or request cache), including memory usage and hit rates.
